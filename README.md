# HKN Job fair sign in 

#### Author: Lucas Tindall

### Run: 
Install node.js

Download repo

cd to repo

`npm init`

`node_modules/forever/bin/forever start app.js` (This will start the site and restart the service if it ever crashes.)

### Notes: 
This is pretty much spaghetti code. There is probably a lot of sloppy/redundant 
code blocks that should be changed. I'll try and clean it up when I have a 
chance.
